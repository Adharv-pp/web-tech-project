        <p><h3>HTML frames, a feature introduced with HTML 4.0, allowed web developers to divide a browser window into multiple sections, each capable of displaying a different HTML document. This was achieved using the <frameset> element, which could be used to define a layout of rows and columns, and the <frame> element to specify the content of each section.

            Frames provided a way to create more complex and interactive web layouts, such as sidebars, menus, or navigation bars, that remained visible while different content was loaded in the main area of the page. They were particularly useful for maintaining a consistent user interface across multiple pages.
            
            However, frames and framesets have largely fallen out of favor due to several issues. They can complicate navigation and bookmarking, as users can find it challenging to link directly to a specific frame. Additionally, frames can negatively impact accessibility, SEO, and user experience. Modern web development practices have moved away from frames in favor of more flexible and user-friendly techniques like CSS layout modules (such as Flexbox and Grid) and JavaScript for dynamic content loading. These newer methods offer better support for responsive design, accessibility, and seamless integration with contemporary web standards.</h3></p>
